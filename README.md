# m3-query
Web interface for search and retrieval of video annotations

## Overview

We are currently in the use-case and requirements gathering phase of this project. Use cases, requirements, and user stories should be submitted under [Issues](https://github.com/mbari-media-management/m3-query/issues)

1. __Requirements__: What the system should do.
2. __Use cases__: A textual description that captures user/system interaction
    - [Non-techie guide on how to write a use case](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/use-cases.html)
    - They do not require technical knowledge
    - A description of what the technology needs to do without actually knowing how it's built.
    - Diagrams are welcome. Either via a link (e.g. it's on Google Docs) or drag an image/file onto the Issue with your use case.
    - Used to help us ask smart questions to uncover gaps in thinking and understanding of the requirements.
    - [Example use case](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/use-cases.html)
3. __User stories__: Short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability 
    - Really easy to write. 
    - [How to write a great user story](https://docs.ca.com/en-us/ca-agile-central/saas/writing-great-user-story)
    - They typically follow a simple template: 
        > As a `type of user`, I want `some goal` so that `some reason`.
